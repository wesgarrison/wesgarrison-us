<h2>I like printing just a few pictures at a time</h2>
<p>One of the things I loved about Costco Photo was being able to print just a few pictures, so I am curious how my past orders would compare now.</p>
<p>I love that I have a camera with me at all times, but having my pictures locked up behind a screen means I don't see them as much. So, I tend to print out 10-ish pictures every couple months.</p>
<p>I also print posters for my office and have printed headshots for customers, so I grabbed a few actual orders and made a comparison.</p>

<p>Aside: This is not a easy chart to read. I think at the "10 print, economy shipping" level each single print ("Inc Price") costs 9 cents to ship, plus a base fee of $1.88, but clearly this chart is meant to make you go think about something else.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>For my typical use case, this is now 243% more than before.</p>
<p>I wonder who at Shutterfly came up with "we can advertise a lower price per print, we will just add a per-print shipping fee!"  The unit prices (after the discount) are generally comparable, but then the additional shipping kicks in.</p>

                <p>Sometimes I take my laptop away from my desk, but the connection to my bluetooth mouse is still strong enough to stay connected. It will be just strong enough to prevent the trackpad from enabling, so I can't mouse up to the menu to turn off Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Same problem in reverse when I get back to the desk and dock; the mouse won't connect because I disabled Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Goal: a command-line way to enable or disable bluetooth.</p>
<p>I found <code>blueutil</code>, here is how to use it.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p><code>brew install blueutil</code></p>
<h3>Use</h3>
<p>There is a command line flag <code>-p</code> for turning Bluetooth on/off with a <code>1 || 0</code>.</p>
<p><code># Turn bluetooth off by passing a 0</code><br><code>blueutil -p 0</code><br><br><code># Turn bluetooth on by passing a 1</code><br><code>blueutil -p 1</code></p>

                <p>Sometimes a project is finished. The chapter is over. A campaign is won or lost, an app is retired, or you don't want to keep something up-to-date but you want a historical archive.</p>

<p>A quick summary of the options:</p>
<pre>-w 5 = wait 5 seconds between requests<br><br><code>--no-if-modified-since</code> allows the forcing if you have local copies<br><br><code>--no-http-keep-alive</code> starts a new session each time, useful if you are getting 429 too many requests on the same channel (use with a longer timeout)<br><br>--span-hosts =&gt; enables spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving <br><br>--domain-list=&lt;comma separated domain list&gt; =&gt; used to set the domains to be followed for file retrieving</pre>
<p>If you have a website hosted somewhere, you probably have assets that come from the host's platform, so spanning multiple domains for the given allows you to get everything.</p>

                <p>Letting go of what I cannot control has been a recent focus for me.</p>
<p>I've realized that I don't care very much about the <strong>output</strong> of a goal. For me, a goal like <em>make a million dollars </em>or <em>squat X hundred pounds</em> does not motivate me. I don't know what to do with that. They aren't directly controllable.</p>
<p>For me, I want to continue to focus on knowing where I want to end up, so that I can build the path to get there. Building the path means creating <strong>input-based goals</strong> instead of <strong>output-based goals</strong>.</p>
<p>I can control the inputs, like <em>make 20 cold calls every afternoon</em> which will lead to more conversation and mroe customers and more revenue. Or, <em>follow a workout plan and lift progressively heavy weights three times a week</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but don't nobody wants to lift no heavy ass weights -- Ronnie Coleman</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="661" height="370" style="width: 661px; height: 370px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYct076lQ3o" title="Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder - Ronnie Coleman" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>More and more, though, I have been trying to build <em>systems</em> for these input-based metrics. I just won't think "hey, it's time to go to the gym" because my brain does not work that way. Instead, I need "if this, then that" type of systems: "after I drop the kid at school, I go to the gym." </p>
<p>This system works great... when school is in session. Over holiday break, though? The gym hours are irregular and it's dark and I don't have to get out to take a kid to school. Finding systems that are resilient to interruption require a bit of extra planning but I am finding they are worth it. Getting into the rhythym makes it so much easier. That mental pathway of "if this, then that" getting established takes a while but is more likely to carry through when disruptions happen.</p>

                <p>Sometimes in scripts or chained commands I want to reset the terminal. After playing around, I set this as an alias in my shell:</p>
<pre><code>echo -ne '\033]50;ClearScrollback\a'</code></pre>
<p>This clears the scrollback without resetting the terminal like <code>reset</code>.</p>

                <p>I switched my code editor to remove trailing whitespace upon save. It's fantastic to not have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Preferences &gt; Settings &gt;  Create <code>trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true</code></p>
<p>It is SO annoying when you change one line in a file but all the other trailing whitespace gets removed so the whole file looks like it changed.</p>
<h3>Remove all the trailing whitespace at once</h3>
<p><code>ack --print0 -l '[ \t]+$' | xargs -0 -n1 perl -pi -e 's/[ \t]+$//'</code></p>
<p>Remove it at once and make one big commit.</p>
