If we get to meet, here are topics we might have in common.</p><h2>Family</h2><p>My wife &amp; kids are near and dear to me and we spend a lot of time together. Growing small humans into larger responsible humans takes a lot of care.</p><h2>Software Development / Ruby &amp; Rails</h2><p>I started using Ruby &amp; Rails in 2005, pre-1.0 and have never left. I helped produce conferences like Ruby Midwest, ran the local Kansas City Ruby group for several years, and mentoring many new programmers into their professional programmer careers.</p><h2>Elections</h2><p>I started working as an election judge when I graduated college. If it's possible, you should do it, too! I am working to improve voting methods by education and trying to change policy.</p><h2>Barbeque</h2><p>I am from Kansas City, so it's basically a requirement to own a smoker and cook something low and slow.</p><h2>Volleyball</h2><p>My daughter wanted to play volleyball. The team needed a coach, so I learned an awful lot about volleyball and life along the way.</p><h2>Physics &amp; Economics</h2><p>I taught physics to help pay my way through college and enjoyed being around particle accelerators and the academic environment.</p><p>Economics has been a later enjoyment, both through reading and through podcasts like Planet Money.</p><h2>Making things</h2><p>I love to make things. Home improvement projects: I've built two kitchens from scratch &amp; am slowly finishing my basement. 3D printing fascinates me. Gardening makes things from sun and water that you can eat! Software lets you interact with things in the real world. </p><h2>Ultimate &amp; Disc Golf</h2><p>I played and ran the Kansas State club ultimate team while in college and several friends loved disc golf. During the 2020 pandemic, I played a <strong>lot</strong> more and made an application (<a href="discgolfbagbuilder.com/">discgolfbagbuilder.com</a>) to track discs and visualize where they will fly. Acquired by uDisc.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">© Wes Garrison, 2005-2023</div></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://wesgarrison.github.io/wesgarrison-us/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
