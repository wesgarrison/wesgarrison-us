I just won't think \"hey, it's time to go to the gym\" because my brain does not work that way. Instead, I need \"if this, then that\" type of systems: \"after I drop the kid at school, I go to the gym.\" </p>\n<p>This system works great... when school is in session. Over holiday break, though? The gym hours are irregular and it's dark and I don't have to get out to take a kid to school. Finding systems that are resilient to interruption require a bit of extra planning but I am finding they are worth it. Getting into the rhythym makes it so much easier. That mental pathway of \"if this, then that\" getting established takes a while but is more likely to carry through when disruptions happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
